This file contains board-specific information for the Momentum Ocelot-G
SBC.  This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious
caveats that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the
target board's reference entry (e.g., man cp7000g for UNIX or the HTML
reference entries) provides board-specific information necessary to run
VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be read fully before this BSP
is used.
